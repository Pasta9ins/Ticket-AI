# **AI-Powered Ticket Management System**

Hey everyone! I'm thrilled to share **Ticket AI**, a smart and scalable issue tracking system built using the MERN stack, that uses AI (Gemini) to automatically categorize, prioritize, and assign support tickets to the most appropriate moderators.
This app is designed for users to raise technical queries and for moderators to resolve them efficiently.


## With Ticket AI:

- **User**: Can raise, view, and track ticket status and priority in real-time
- **Moderator**: Can view, assign, and resolve tickets based on skills
